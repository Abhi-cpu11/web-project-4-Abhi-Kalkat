          <h1>Residential (Lower and Medium Density)</h1>
          <p>
            In the future Naawi-Oodena, housing actually means something. It’s
            not just a bunch of buildings stacked together. This place feels
            like home. You’ve got a solid mix of homes depending on how you
            live. There are quiet streets with family houses, and there are also
            mid-rise apartments and stacked townhomes that still feel like they
            belong to the land. Whether it’s elders, young adults, families, or
            someone just starting out, everyone has a space here. You’re not
            boxed in. It’s open, walkable, and everywhere you go, you’re
            surrounded by nature. That makes a difference. Even right in the
            city, it feels calm and grounded.

          <h1>Commercial Mixed-Use</h1>
          <p>
            This part of Naawi-Oodena has a different kind of energy. It’s not
            just stores and office buildings. It’s a place where things happen.
            Indigenous-owned shops, local cafés, wellness spaces, creative
            studios, even some big stores mixed in — it all fits together. The
            buildings are made to bring people in. Wide sidewalks, space to sit
            and chill, room for patios. You can live upstairs and run a business
            downstairs. You can grab lunch, meet someone for coffee, or just
            walk through and feel like you're part of something. It’s more than
            just convenience. It’s about creating an economy that reflects
            culture and pride.

          <h1>Community Spaces</h1>
          <p>
            This is where Naawi-Oodena really shows who it is. The community
            spaces aren't just parks. They’re built with meaning. You’ll find
            paths that cut through natural areas, mirrored ponds that freeze in
            winter, fire pits, spaces for ceremony, and quiet corners where
            people go to reflect. Native plants fill the landscape. First
            Nations art is part of everything. The design makes it easy to be
            outside and feel connected to the land. It’s a place that works
            year-round. People don’t just pass through they gather, they laugh,
            they remember. It feels good here. Feels like something real.

          <h1>Sports and Recreation</h1>
          <p>
            Naawi-Oodena was made for movement. It doesn’t matter the season.
            There’s always something going on. You’ve got sports fields, rec
            centers, outdoor courts, and big open parks. In the winter, those
            ponds turn into skating rinks. In the summer, they’re full of life.
            There’s a plan for a huge powwow arbour ( traditional Indigenous
            gatherings) too something big enough for the whole community and
            more. This isn’t about just staying fit. It’s about people getting
            together, staying healthy, and keeping the energy of the place
            flowing. Whether you’re into sports or just want to be out and
            moving, you’re covered.

          <h1>Cultural Campus and Education</h1>
          <p>
            This part of Naawi-Oodena is all about learning and legacy. It’s
            where education and culture connect. You’ve got schools, museums,
            art galleries, and a center for Treaty One governance all in one
            place. This is where stories get passed down. Where language,
            ceremony, and identity are built into the walls. It doesn’t feel
            like a regular campus. It feels alive. Every corner has meaning.
            From the art on the buildings to the way the spaces are set up for
            gathering, it’s built for the future but grounded in the past.
            People don’t just come here to learn. They come to grow.

        <div>
          <h1>Mixed-Use Village</h1>
          <p>
            The village core is where it all comes together. It’s the heart of
            the place. You can live here, eat here, shop, hang out, see art, and
            go to events, all within walking distance. The streets are built for
            people, not cars. You’ve got homes on top of businesses, wide
            sidewalks, outdoor seating, public art, and everything is done with
            culture in mind. It’s not crowded or chaotic. It’s chill and
            designed to feel good. There’s even space for a future transit hub.
            Whether you live in this part or not, you’re probably going to end
            up here just to feel that pulse.

          <h1>Nightlife</h1>
          <p>
            When the sun goes down, Naawi-Oodena doesn’t sleep. It glows. The
            nightlife is different here. It’s not clubs and chaos. It’s
            community. You’ve got rooftop patios, outdoor music spots, night
            markets with Indigenous food, and cafés hosting open mic nights.
            Some nights you hear drumming. Some nights it’s just calm voices
            around a fire. It’s safe. It’s lit up. And it feels alive without
            being loud. The night in Naawi-Oodena has its own rhythm. It’s about
            being together, celebrating culture, and letting the place breathe
            after dark. No pressure. Just vibes.
