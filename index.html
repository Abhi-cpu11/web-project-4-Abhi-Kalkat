        <h2>Sports and Recreation</h2>
          <p>Naawi-Oodena was made for movement. It doesn’t matter the season. There’s always something going on. You’ve got sports fields, rec centers, outdoor courts, and big open parks. In the winter, those ponds turn into skating rinks. In the summer, they’re full of life. There’s a plan for a huge powwow arbour ( traditional Indigenous gatherings)  too something big enough for the whole community and more. This isn’t about just staying fit. It’s about people getting together, staying healthy, and keeping the energy of the place flowing. Whether you’re into sports or just want to be out and moving, you’re covered.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Campus and Education</h2>
          <p>This part of Naawi-Oodena is all about learning and legacy. It’s where education and culture connect. You’ve got schools, museums, art galleries, and a center for Treaty One governance all in one place. This is where stories get passed down. Where language, ceremony, and identity are built into the walls. It doesn’t feel like a regular campus. It feels alive. Every corner has meaning. From the art on the buildings to the way the spaces are set up for gathering, it’s built for the future but grounded in the past. People don’t just come here to learn. They come to grow.</p>
